INHERITENCE : Inheriting properties of other classes 
keyword used : extends 

In Inheritence there is a Base class (parent class) and Derived class (child class)

Types of INHERITENCE 

1. Single level Inheritence : Inheritence till a single class 
    
    Base Class --> Derived Class

2. Multi level Inheritence : Inheritence continues from the derived class too

    Base Class --> Derived class --> Derived class

3. Hierarchial inheritance

                   ---Derived Class
                  /
    Base Class ---
                  \ 
                   ---Derived Class

4. Hybrid Inheritence

                   ---Derived Class --> Derived class
                  /
    Base Class ---
                  \ 
                   ---Derived Class


5. Multiple Inheritence [ it is available in C++ , in Java we use Interfaces to implement the same ]

   Base Class ---
                 \
                  --- Derived Class
                 /
   Base Class ---

ENCAPSULATION : When data and functions are combined in a single entity.
                Creating a class & objects can also be known as encapsulation.

PACKAGES & ACCESS MODIFIERS
 
    PACKAGE :

        Package is wrapping similar things together.
        
        Types of packages in Java 

        1. Buildin Packages 
            Eg. java.util which contains Scanner class
        
        2. User Packages
            - Packages which are defined by the user

    ACCESS MODIFIERS :

        Types of access modifiers 

        1.Public type : 
            - Information in the class can be accessed by anyone 
            - It can also be accessed in other package too
            - Main function needs to be Public so that it is always accessible

        2. Default type :
            - Exists by default 
            - within the package the class can be accessed if the access modifier is set to default 

        3. Protected type :
            - Within the package can be accessed
            - In other packages only sub-classes can access it

        4. Private type :
            - It can only be accessed within the class only 
            
        ** To accesss private we Use
            Getters and Setters functions

            Getters is used to give the information of the private things
            Setters are used to set the information for the private things

            - You can set the setter as private to hide the information from the user too.


    DATA HIDING : 
        - It is the process of protecting members of calss from unintended changes.
        [ Abstraction is hiding the implementation details and showing only important/useful parts to the user.]

        - Using access modifiers we can hide the data however needed
